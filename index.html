        <h2>About Anya</h2>
        <pa>Anya Forger is a really cute character.
            She is capable of reading the minds of other people and animals, her ability depicted as small sparks around her head.
            However, she is sensitive to being in large crowds as she becomes overwhelmed and dizzy by too many thoughts, to the point of getting a nosebleed. 
            Anya finds it difficult to understand complicated minds, such as Loid's</pa><br>
